Hi,
I had made an Python file which does opens the typing website "https://10ff.net/login" using Chrome WebDriver (Note : Only Works Through Chrome). It Types the words Automate Using Selenium Python Package To drive the Web HTML and to automate type. Try This Let Have Fun!

You can update the Chrome WebDriver Through "https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads"
